                    During my 2019 summer REU in Reno, Nevada, the dorm I was
                    staying in exploded. A boiler failure had caused the two
                    separate explosions and fire, the second of which caused
                    building to explode. Miraculously, no one was severely hurt
                    and escaped just in time. It is safe to say that this event
                    had a significant impact on my REU that summer and will
                    always be something I will remember for the rest of my life.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I still remember that faithful day of the explosion. I was
                    eating my microwaved lunch in my dorm room along side my
                    roommate when the fire alarm had gone off. We both looked at
                    each other and rolled our eyes because we had previously had
                    a fire drill less than a week ago at 6:45 in the morning.
                    Reluctantly, I slipped on my shoes and walked out the room.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    However, I noticed there was something off. Our whole
                    hallway was pitch black and the doors to the stairwell,
                    which were normally kept open, were shut. I started to feel
                    a sense of panic as I ran into the stairwell. Everyone was
                    rushing down the stairs. As I ran down the stairs, I noted
                    that the stairwell had a slight smell of gas. Once my eyes
                    met the bright sunlight after exiting the building, the
                    street was filled with fire trucks and RAs and officers
                    ushering us to move along. We were directed across the
                    street where I sat on a barrier. <br />
                    <br />
                    For 5 minutes, I could only hear the indistinctive chatter
                    between the officers and the firemen. The fire alarm from
                    the building was constantly beeping in the background. Then,
                    I remember feeling as if the ground had imploded underneath
                    me. I was met with a boom that shook me to my core -- a
                    sound that I will never forget. A piece of the roof flies
                    into the air and I watch it land near me on the street.
                    That's when everyone around me starts to scream and run away
                    from the building. The windows had been blown out and the
                    entrance to the building I had exited from not 5 minutes ago
                    was caved out by the explosion. Smoke filled the building
                    and escaped into the air. I remember feeling just sheer
                    panic and terror as I fled alongside everyone else.

                    It is without a doubt that this traumatic event had an
                    immense impact on me. For the rest of the day, I was in
                    shock and remembered just feeling dread as I progressed
                    through the day. I had no access to any of my belongings,
                    including my clothes and my laptop. Every time I stepped
                    into a different building, the terrifying thought of whether
                    or not the boiler would explode would be in the back of my
                    mind. From this point on, I can't help but feel a jolt of
                    panic when I hear a fire alarm, regardless of whether it is
                    a drill or not. As these pictures manifest the damage of the
                    explosion, it is clear why this was a traumatic event that
                    would last in my memory for a lifetime.

                    Since this explosion occurred during the middle of the REU,
                    I still had an abundant amount of research to do. I had to
                    replace my clothes and other belongings, since most were
                    temporarily lost in the building. Despite this, I went into
                    the lab next day to ensure that I met that week's deadline.
                    Since the REU was on a strict schedule, I couldn't let this
                    event delay my progress I was making in my work. In fact, I
                    successfully met all the remaining deadlines for the REU and
                    successfully delivered my research project alongside a full
                    research paper. Even though this immense mishap displaced
                    myself and my friends, I used it as an opportunity to
                    manifest my perseverance and goal-orientated attitude.
