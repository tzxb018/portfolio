            <p>
                During my 2019 summer REU in Reno, Nevada, the dorm I was staying in exploded. A boiler failure had caused the two separate explosions and fire, the second of which caused building to explode. Miraculously, no one was severely hurt and escaped just in
                time. It is safe to say that this event had a significant impact on my REU that summer and will always be something I will remember for the rest of my life.
                <br /> <br> Here is a general timeline of the events of the explosion on July 5th, 2019: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mid-day: Boiler technician arrives to repair and replace part on boiler.</li>
                    <li>~Noon: I arrive in my dorm room and prepare a sandwich and turn on the Flash for lunch.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        12:42 p.m.: Initial boiler explosion occurs.
                    </li>
                    <li>12:44 p.m.: A gas line is severed.</li>
                    <li>12:44 p.m: The fire alarm notifies myself and everyone in Argenta Hall.</li>
                    <li>12:45 p.m.: My roommate and I leave our room to see a pitch-black hallway.</li>
                    <li>12:46 p.m.: As we evacuate, I remember smelling gas in the hallway and the staircase. </li>
                    <li>12:47 p.m: Initial fire was extinguished, but a free flow of natural gas from 3-inch pipe travels up elevator shaft. </li>
                    <li>12:51 p.m.: Reno Fire Department engine 4 dispatched to Argenta Hall. </li>
                    <li>1:02 p.m.: Second major explosion blows out the windows, walls, and the roof of the building. </li>
                    <li>~1:30 p.m: Regroup with my friends and try to figure out what to do and where to sleep for the night while still in shock. </li>
                    <li>~9:30 p.m.: Finally find a place to sleep for the night in the neighboring hall, Peavine Hall. </li>
                </ul>

                <!-- <br /> I still remember that fateful day of the explosion. I was eating my microwaved lunch in my dorm room along side my roommate when the fire alarm had gone off. We both looked at each other and rolled our eyes because we had previously
                had a fire drill less than a week ago at 6:45 in the morning. Reluctantly, I slipped on my shoes and walked out the room.
                <br />
                <br /> However, I noticed there was something off. Our whole hallway was pitch black and the doors to the stairwell, which were normally kept open, were shut. I started to feel a sense of panic as I ran into the stairwell. Everyone was
                rushing down the stairs. As I ran down the stairs, I noted that the stairwell had a slight smell of gas. Once my eyes met the bright sunlight after exiting the building, the street was filled with fire trucks and RAs and officers ushering
                us to move along. We were directed across the street where I sat on a barrier. <br />
                <br /> For 5 minutes, I could only hear the indistinctive chatter between the officers and the firemen. The fire alarm from the building was constantly beeping in the background. Then, I remember feeling as if the ground had imploded underneath
                me. I was met with a boom that shook me to my core -- a sound that I will never forget. A piece of the roof flies into the air and I watch it land near me on the street. That's when everyone around me starts to scream and run away from
                the building. The windows had been blown out and the entrance to the building I had exited from not 5 minutes ago was caved out by the explosion. Smoke filled the building and escaped into the air. I remember feeling just sheer panic and
                terror as I fled alongside everyone else. -->

                It is without a doubt that this traumatic event had an immense impact on me. For the rest of the day, I was in shock and remembered just feeling dread as I progressed through the day. I had no access to any of my belongings, including my clothes and my
                laptop. Every time I stepped into a different building, the terrifying thought of whether or not the boiler would explode would be in the back of my mind. From this point on, I can't help but feel a jolt of panic when I hear a fire alarm,
                regardless of whether it is a drill or not. As these pictures manifest the damage of the explosion, it is clear why this was a traumatic event that would last in my memory for a lifetime.

                Since this explosion occurred during the middle of the REU, I still had an abundant amount of research to do. I had to replace my clothes and other belongings, since most were temporarily lost in the building. Despite this, I went into the lab next day
                to ensure that I met that week's deadline. Since the REU was on a strict schedule, I couldn't let this event delay my progress I was making in my work. In fact, I successfully met all the remaining deadlines for the REU and successfully
                delivered my research project alongside a full research paper. Even though this immense mishap displaced myself and my friends, I used it as an opportunity to manifest my perseverance and goal-orientated attitude.
